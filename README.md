docs## Overview
This is a simulation of a fast-food restaurant in a UK pub, implemented using the SimPy simulation library in Python. The simulation models customer arrivals, order placement, food preparation, and order delivery. The goal of the simulation is to optimize the restaurant's performance by minimizing customer wait times and maximizing the number of customers served.

## Features
- Models customer arrivals, order placement, food preparation, and order delivery
- Optimizes restaurant performance by minimizing customer wait times and maximizing the number of customers served
- Easy-to-use command-line interface
- Modular code structure for easy customization and extension
- Comprehensive test suite for confident code changes
- Well-documented codebase

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- SimPy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/rogermt/pub-restaurant-simulation.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
Run the simulation from the command line with:
